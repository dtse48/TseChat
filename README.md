About TseChat:

- TseChat is a Node.js application that demonstrates the usage of HTML, JavaScript, Express, and Socket.io to create a live messaging application

- TseChat prompts the user to enter their username, select a chatroom, and join that room to begin chatting

- Once the user has joined a room, they can send messages, see who else is in the room, and leave to join a different room

- The chatrooms are live:

    - a message sent by one user will immediately be shown to all users in the same room
    - the list of users in a room updates when a user joins/leaves so as to accurately reflect who is in the room
    - each chat message is tagged with the username of the sender and the actual time at which the message was sent
    - users are notified when a user joins/leaves the room
